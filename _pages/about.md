I am a second-year PhD student in Statistics at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). Before that, I completed my BA in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and BA in [Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), graduating *Summa cum laude*. At Berkeley, I had the privilege of working with [Anil Aswani](https://aswani.ieor.berkeley.edu/), [Cyrus Dioun](https://business.ucdenver.edu/about/our-people/cyrus-dioun), and [Haichen Wang](https://hwang43.web.cern.ch/), focusing on the application of optimization and deep learning models in sociology, particle physics, and tensor completion.

My research interests span statistical machine learning and optimization. I am deeply interested in developing methodologies and models that offer practical applications while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees. Lately, I have been particularly drawn to online and interactive learning algorithms, like bandit algorithms. Additionally, I am working on enhancing the causal validity of search engine experiments by integrating network interference into [performative prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06673) framework with [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/zaid-harchaoui/).
