This is a class project for STAT 517, Stochastic Modelling of Scientific Data, in Winter 2024. 
The project is about summarizing the main research problem in the paper [Constructing Priors that Penalize the Complexity of Gaussian Random Fields](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2017.1415907), connecting the main contribution
in the selected paper with materials studied in STAT 517, proposing the simplified version of the main contribution, and conducting
the simulation study on the simplified version. 

[Here](/assets/pdf/STAT_517_Winter_2024_Final_Project.pdf) is the full report.
