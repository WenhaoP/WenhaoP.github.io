This is a class project for STAT 547, Machine Learning for Big Data, in Spring 2024. This study aims to understand how moral judgments are formed within online communities, specifically through the analysis of the r/AmITheAsshole subreddit. We utilized machine learning models, including BERT and LightGBM, along with topic classification via BERTopic, to identify key features influencing moral judgment. The results indicated that demographic information like gender and age, as well as the sentiment conveyed in the title, play a significant role in the communityâ€™s verdict.
